# Konrad Lipinski's Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my data science portfolio! My name is Konrad and I am a student studying Management & Artificial Intelligence in Poland at Kozminski University.
This portfolio showcases my data science projects, which I have worked on as part of my coursework and personal projects.
